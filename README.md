# Selections Round Task: CTF
The project was to make a presentation about Capture The Flag events. 

## The Process:
Having been exposed to linux terminal and basic cybersecurity topics very recently, the whole process for making this presentation was quite enlightening and very interersting. I started off with a few basic prolems on picoCTF, solving them on the webshell. Initially it were mostly related to hashing, encoding and web-exploitation. Then I went in for a playlist on picoCTF for begineers, that introduced me to all types of challenges. After solving about 25 questions in there, I went on to try some other platforms, TryHackMe and HackTheBox were the best ones here. I stuck to HackTheBox, and started doing challenges for CTF event names "Try-Outs". I'd say a basic for beginners but has all types of problems of varying difficulty. I joined the discord servers for THM and HTB. One day, Try-Outs went down, and instead we had "Cyber-Apocalypse 2205" CTF event. It was a full fledged real-time CTF event. I went in to only solve the easier RE challenges. Event among them, I could only solve 2. Since, during live events people don't help each other, I had to give up. Then I explored a few crackmes from crackmes.one and was looking at Wargames on OverTheWire.

Lastly, the deadline for ppt submission closed in. I wanted to use RevealJS but without using it's GUI version (Slides, paid) it seemed to have a bit of a learning curve. Hence, I chose to stick with PowerPoint.
Collected screenshots from my Kali VM as assets for different slides, and with a bit of help from GPT finished the PPT in a couple of days.

## Learning from the Task
Had fun getting used to linux terminal and learning tools like objdump, gdb, etc.
Learning IDA and ghidra was mostly a guess at start then after a few youtube videos and messing around, I understood how things work there.
Still trying to figure out debugging tools for dynamic analysis, not too used to it yet.
